# Trails and Tweaks

- Chiseled Bookshelves don't require silk touch to pick up.
- Decorated Pots won't be broken by tools.
- Decorated Pots aren't crafted using sherds, instead you can apply sherds to existing pots, copying the design onto the pot without consuming the sherd.
- Brushable blocks aren't destroyed by falling or breaking, allowing you to move them and brush them later.
- Brushes don't take durability damage.
- Brushes can be used on various blocks such as mossy cobblestone to clean them.
- Torchflowers are invasive to wheat and can consume it to spread more of itself.
- Torchflowers consume water at a faster rate than other plants, drying out farmland.
- Torchflowers can be lit with a flint and steel to create a new light source, a Torchspark.
- Pitcher Pods can grow more than one Pitcher Plant.
- Pitcher Plants act as a water source, filling nearby cauldrons with water and hydrating farmland.
- Sniffer Eggs won't grow unless they're on a hatch speed booster such as moss, so they can be used for building without hatching.
- Sniffers can be ridden by up to 3 players at once, and the player in front can put a torchflower seed on a stick to control it.
- Camels can now pick up nearby friendly entities like a boat, and carry them along. You can shift click on a camel to have it drop the entities off.

- Hanging Signs will sway in the wind.
